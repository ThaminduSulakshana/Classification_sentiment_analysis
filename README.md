# Sentiment analysis web application

The repository contains a Machine learning-based application that trains sentiment analysis models of this project using various machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. Each of these algorithms brings its own unique approach to understanding and predicting sentiment patterns in text data. The app is built using the Flask web framework and offers an intuitive interface to enter text and get sentiment predictions. You can access the live version of this web application [here](https://sentimentbox.azurewebsites.net/).
